# scRNA_seq
An attempt at replicating a few analyses from this paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03569-1#Sec44)

Due to restrictions on computing power and memory, only two samples (C56ctr, L01cov) were analysed. Therefore, the results mentioned here would not be the same mentioned in the paper.

* "C56ctr" is the control sample while "L01cov" is the sample from a patient with COVID19.
