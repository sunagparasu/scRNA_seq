# scRNA_seq
An attempt at replicating a few analyses from this paper (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03569-1#Sec44)

Due to restrictions on computing power and memory, only two samples (C56ctr, L01cov) were analysed. Therefore, the results mentioned here would not be the same mentioned in the paper.

1. leiden_umap_1.png shows the corresponding group assignments of the cells in the UMAP.
* "C56ctr" is the control sample while "L01cov" is the sample from a patient with COVID19.
2. leiden_umap_2.png shows the subpopulation assignments with numbers.
3. leiden_umap_2.png shows the subgroups of cells present in the samples.
4. heatmap.png shows the differentially expressed genes between the control and the COVID19 sample. Genes like LAMA3 and PARD3 were found to be highly expressed in the sample with COVID19
